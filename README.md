## Sea of Thieves Keymaster's Keep

A Keymaster's Keep implementation for Sea of Thieves, for use with the randomizer software Archipelago. This is a simple script I spun up for myself and my friends which allows for playing Sea of Thieves in Archipelago without modifying the game in anyway. I assume visitors to this page are familiar with Keymaster's Keep, but if not, please first refer to their page:
https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases?q=Keymaster&expanded=true

Use of this script is simple as downloading the .py file and placing it within the 'keymasters_keep' directory of your Archipelago install directory after successfully implementing Keymaster's Keep. Create a .yaml file by generating template options in Archipelago, then make sure Sea of Thieves is included in game_selection. There are also 4 SoT specific options currently implemented to adjust your playthrough.
